To run the program, download the 2 files into the same directory on your computer. Overwrite the current input.txt file with your file and name it the same 'input.txt'
Start a console session, cd to the directory where the 2 files are stored and type: node app.js
If the hoover robot ever hits the wall of the room dimensions (or starts out of the room initially), the program will exit and display the current position and dirt picked up up until exit
Please only use N,E,S,W as directions for the robot. All other directions will be ignored and a console message will be displayed stating: "You gave the hoover some bad directions.."
Have fun!
