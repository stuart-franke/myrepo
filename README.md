To run the program, overwrite your input.txt file
Start a console session and type: node app.js
If the hoover robot ever hits the wall of the room dimensions (or start originally out of the room), the program will exit and display the current position and dirt picked up
Please only use N,E,S,W as directions for the robot. All other directions will be ignored and a console message will be displayed stating: "You gave the hoover some bad directions.."
Have fun!
